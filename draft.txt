        console.log(`RIGHT      ${position + 1}: ${squares[position + 1]}`)
        console.log(`LEFT       ${position - 1}: ${squares[position - 1]}`)
        console.log(`UP         ${position - 8}: ${squares[position - 8]}`)
        console.log(`DOWN       ${position + 8}: ${squares[position + 8]}`)
        console.log(`DOWN-LEFT  ${position + 7}: ${squares[position + 7]}`)
        console.log(`DOWN-RIGHT ${position + 9}: ${squares[position + 9]}`)
        console.log(`UP-LEFT    ${position - 7}: ${squares[position - 7]}`)
        console.log(`UP-RIGHT   ${position - 9}: ${squares[position - 9]}`)
    }
